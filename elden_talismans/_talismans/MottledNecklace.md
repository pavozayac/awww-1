Raises Robustness, Immunity, and Focus(+1 available)

>*A vividly-colored accoutrement precious to the ancestral followers. Raises immunity, robustness, and focus. Said to be a budding horn. The ancestral followers believed that the horns of a long-lived beast continue to bud like antlers, over and over again, until the beast one day becomes an ancestral spirit.*
