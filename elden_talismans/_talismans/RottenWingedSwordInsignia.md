Raises attack power with successive attacks

>*A talisman depicting a raised prosthetic blade. An honor bestowed upon the valkyries who serve the goddess of rot.  Greatly raises attack power with successive attacks. The Four sisters were born in the swamp of Aeonia, and came to the Haligtree under the aegis of Gowry. And yet, those buds were doomed to never blossom.*
