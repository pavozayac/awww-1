Raises Fire Damage, but lowers damage negations

>*A talisman fashioned from a scale that embodies the aspects of various creatures.Said to have grown on the human body long ago. Reduces damage taken from critical hits. A vestige of the crucible of primordial life. Born partially of devolution, it was considered a signifier of the divine in ancient times, but is now increasingly disdained as an impurity as civilization has advanced.*
