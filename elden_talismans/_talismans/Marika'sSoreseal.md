Raises Mind, Intelligence, Faith, and Arcane, but increases damage taken

>*This legendary talisman is an eye engraved with an Elden Rune, said to be the seal of Queen Marika.  Greatly raises mind, intelligence, faith, and arcane, but also increases damage taken by a similar measure. Solemn duty weighs upon the one beholden; not unlike a gnawing curse from which there is no deliverance.*
