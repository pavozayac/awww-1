Renders the wearer immune to Fall Damage

>*Disturbing likeness of a man whose eyes have been gouged out.The corners of his mouth are upturned in an almost flirtatious manner. Constantly attracts enemies' aggression. It is said that the man, named Shabriri, had his eyes gouged out as punishment for the crime of slander, and, with time, the blight of the flame of frenzy came to dwell in the empty sockets.*
